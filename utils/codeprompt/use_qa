Please now remember the steps:

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.
First lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, As well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including ALL code.
Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that
FILENAME is the lowercase file name including the file extension. The line that contains the FILENAME should only include the FILENAME itself, without any additional information such as a serial number or a colon. For instance, "1. app.js:" should be transformed to "app.js".
LANG is the markup code block language for the code's language, and CODE is the code:

FILENAME
```LANG
CODE
```

Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.

You will start with the "entrypoint" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.
Follow a language and framework appropriate best practice file naming convention.
Make sure that files contain all imports, types etc. The code should be fully functional. Make sure that code in different files are compatible with each other.
Before you finish, double check that all parts of the architecture is present in the files.
